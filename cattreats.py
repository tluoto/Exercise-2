'''cattreats.py

This simple script finds the location of a selected cat's name in one list and
its favorite treat at the corresponding location in another. Both items are
printed to the screen afterward.

Limitations:
This code will not work if the cat's name is not in list of cat names.

Usage: ./cattreats.py
